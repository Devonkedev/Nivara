## About Niva

**Niva** is a misinformation detection and verification system. It offers a platform where **academic scholars** verify the accuracy of articles and other media. By utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, the app also automates the initial analysis of content, flagging it as potentially truthful or misleading. This multi-layered approach aims to ensure the reliability of information consumed by users.

## Key Features

### 1. Expert Verification

Niva integrates **subject-matter expertise** as a core part of its fact-checking process. **Qualified scholars** review articles based on their expertise, assessing the truthfulness of the content.

- Scholars are matched to articles based on their domain knowledge (e.g., medical articles are reviewed by doctors or medical researchers).
- Verified experts provide a confidence score after reviewing an article, which is displayed alongside the content.
  
### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

Niva employs state-of-the-art **NLP models** to assist with article evaluation. These models perform an initial pass to flag questionable content:

- NLP algorithms assess linguistic cues and cross-reference available data to detect bias, inconsistencies, or misinformation.
- AI models assign a probability score that indicates whether the content is likely to be true or false, which is then reviewed by scholars for a more detailed examination.

### 3. Incentivized Participation

Scholars are incentivized to contribute by being rewarded for accurate and thorough reviews. Features include:

- **Reward Mechanism:** Scholars earn points or credits based on the quality and frequency of their reviews.
- **Performance-Based Incentives:** A reputation system ensures that scholars with a history of accurate reviews are prioritized for more content and higher rewards.

### 4. User-Friendly Interface

Niva provides an intuitive, clean interface where users can:

- Instantly see the **credibility score** of articles.
- Access detailed **in-depth analysis** (via a premium subscription).
- Interact with visualizations that show how the reliability of an article changes over time as more reviews and analysis are conducted.

### 5. Scalability

Niva is built for future expansion, allowing for additional media types to be verified:

- **Images and Videos:** Upcoming features will enable image and video fact-checking, addressing visual misinformation and deepfakes.
- The system is designed to handle an increasing number of users, reviews, and content types without sacrificing performance.
